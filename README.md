# Delfi
Delfi is a simple onchain price oracle you can reason about. It provides a liquidity-weighted index of ETH/DAI prices from decentralized exchanges. The price is backed up by the ETH amount required to move the rate more than 5%. This provides a quantifiable threshold of economic activity the price can safely support.
